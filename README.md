# ProjectEuler
My (ongoing) solutions for Project Euler problems in either Python or C.

I am playing with (re-)learning Python and C using various problems to solve. Here I hope to learn about the different ways to solve problems using C and Python and the different idiosyncrasies of using the two languages.

Feel free to contribute suggestions and tweaks to make solutions more 'Python-ic' or 'C'
